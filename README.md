# A Pokemon classifier using logistic regression. 

In Jupyter Notebook form so you can play with it easily and test your own models. Other approaches were considered, such as SVM, GloVe (with logistic regression) and Naive Bayes. But logistic regression and tf-idf had the highest F1 score (~75%).


Uses minimal data, which have been adapted from veekun's Pokedex repo, which contains all the data you never knew you wanted about Pokemon.
